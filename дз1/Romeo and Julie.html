    <h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
    <h2>ACT 1</h2>
    <h2>PROLOGUE</h2>
    <p>Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
      In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
      From ancient grudge, break to new mutiny,<br>
      Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
      5From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
      A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life,<br>
      Whose misadventured piteous overthrows°<br>
      Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.<br>
      This fearful showing of their death-marked love,<br>
      10And the exhibition of their parents’ rage<br>
      Which, but their children’s end, naught could remove<br>
      Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage<br>
      That which–if you with patient ears attend<br>
      Here goes unsaid, our toil shall strive to mend.</p><br>
      <h2>SCENE I. Verona. A public place</h2>
      <p1>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</p1>
      <h2>SAMPSON</h2>
      <p>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>
      <h2>GREGORY</h2>
      <p>No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
